This contains a "template" notes file `lec-template.tex`, that can be copied and modified. Note that you must add `\subfile{<filename>}` to the `main.tex` for successful compilation.

I believe I initially pulled much of the structure of this from Anton Geraschenko, at `stacky.net`. He has a page of his website that includes tips for LiveTex-ing, which I found very useful initially.
